# Codewars_Kata_Challenge1
# Note: If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, only count it once.
# If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

# Finish the solution so that it returns the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below the number passed in. Additionally, if the number is negative, return 0 (for languages that do have them).

# don't forget to add your main function and make a a call to the solution function with any abritary value
# the code may not look neat but Aesthetics wasn't the issue
